    A greedy algorithm is a problem solving method to making the logically optimal choice at each stage.

    You need to give a person R26.50.
    you have the following bills:
    100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.50

    The greedy algorithm method is to ensure the least amount of steps are taken to resolve the issue:
    Where the above can be solved with 10+5+5+5+1+0.50
    Greedy is checking what the largest bill is that can fit into the amounts that is needed and working from there.
    This would be the greedy method to solve this method: 20+5+1+0.50
