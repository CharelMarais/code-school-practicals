2.1
  Big O is used to describe the performance of an algorithm and to determine if its scalable or not.
  This is broken down into time complexity and space complexity.

  - O(1)
  - O(log n)
  - O(n)
  - O(n.log n)
  - O(n^2)
  - O(2^n)
  - O(n!)

2.2
  Stack:
  A stack is a sequence of elements saved in static memory it works under the First-In-Last-Out method
  Heap:
  A heap has no limit to due to it saving data using dynamic memory. It saves data on a hierarchical system

2.3
  Linear search: O(n)
  2D Array: O(n\*m)
  Insertion Sort: O(n^2)

2.4
  Space complexity is refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm or program.
  Merge sort has the space complexity of O(n) due to the input and output array that stays the same length
